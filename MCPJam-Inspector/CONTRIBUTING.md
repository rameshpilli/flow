# Contributing

First off, thank you for considering contributing to MCPJam Inspector! It's people like you that make the open source community such a great place.

## Finding an issue to work on

1. You can find things to work on in our [issues tab](https://github.com/MCPJam/inspector/issues).
2. Look for issues labelled `good first issue` and `very easy`. These are great starter tasks that are low commitment
3. Once you find an issue you like to work on, comment on the issue and tag @matteo8p. Then assign yourself the issue. This helps avoid multiple contributors working on the same issue.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure to have the following:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Fork, Clone, and Branch

1.  **Fork** the repository on GitHub.
2.  **Clone** your fork locally:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/inspector.git
    cd inspector
    ```
3.  Create a new **branch** for your changes:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b my-feature-branch
    ```

### Setup

Install the dependencies for all workspaces:

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

Copy the .env file :

```bash
cp .env.local .env.development
```

To run the client and server in development mode with hot-reloading, use:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This runs:

- **Client**: Vite dev server on `:5173`
- **Server**: Hono dev server on `:3001`

### Electron Development

To run the Electron app in development mode:

```bash
npm run electron:dev
```

This runs:

- Electron main process
- Embedded Hono server
- Vite dev server for renderer

### Building the Project

To build all parts of the project (client, server, and SDK), run:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start // starts the build
```

You can also build each part individually:

- `npm run build:client` - Build React frontend
- `npm run build:server` - Build Hono backend
- `npm run build:sdk` - Build MCP SDK wrapper

### Deploy MCPJam

To deploy MCPJam to a new version:

1. Change the version in `package.json` to the next version. Commit and merge it to `main`.
2. Run `git tag v1.2.3` with the correct version
3. Run `git push origin v1.2.3`. This will kick off a GitHub action to deploy to npm and the electron desktop apps.

## Code Style

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to maintain a consistent code style. Before you commit your changes, please format your code by running:

```bash
npm run prettier-fix
```

## Commit Messages
